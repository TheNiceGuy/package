package
=======
Every package AUR package that I maintain can be cloned from here. Most of the packages are maintained on Archlinux's git repositories. Thus, I have to clone recursively. Archlinux's git repositories have different read and write URLs. In order to setup those different URLs, I had to create a small script that `configure-repo`.
